I like writing about the cool stuff I'm into at the moment, and I'm far too disorganized to have all my posts in one place. So, this will be my third (?) blog that I actively run, except it's going to be a more informal style of posting. I like ranting and talking about anything under the sun, so I'm just going to leave this here for a taste of the kinds of things I'll be posting in case you're trying to decide whether or not you want to look at this again ^_^
